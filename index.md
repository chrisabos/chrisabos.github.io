## Abstract

In the study of Earth History there are many topics to be discussed. One semester is nowhere near long enough to truly understand all of the processes completely that have developed the wonderful planet we call Earth. In this article will be a detailed look into what we know about where life began on Earth. Specifically, when our planet went from a place full of chemicals, into a place that is habitated by numerous life forms.


## Earth Before Life

Earth has had an extremely violent history. When the Earth was first forming it was an extremely violent place. The entire Earth was molten and experienced many impacts from other objects in space. These objects added to both the heat and the size of the planet. As time continued the Earth began to cool naturally and form a crust over the surface. Eventually, once the planet cooled enough, water began to accumulate on the surface to create vast oceans. Despite Earth's still violent nature, this is where life is believed to have begun.

The atmosphere at this time would have been completely different from the atmosphere that we are capabled of breathing today. Because of the extremely volcanic nature of the Earth at the time, it is widely believed that the early atmosphere was mainly consisting of cobon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, methane, ammonia, and sulfur dioxide [1]. Notice that this list does not include oxigen and the levels of methan and sulfur in the atmosphere would make this place completely inhabitable by humans.

So despite this inhospitable environment, how would life have begun?

## Miller-Urey Experiment

Stanley L. Miller at the time of this experiment wanted to understand where life could have come from given the early atmosphere of the Earth. Specifically, he wanted to know if complicated molecular structures like amino acids could have come from simple inorganic chemicals. Harold Urey, his professor at the time did not think that this would be worth pursuing as this field of chemistry is largely unknown. Miller, after much persuasion of Urey, continued with his experiment.

The experiment was remarkably simple. It involved a couple of chemical chambers to hold water and precipitation and it was sealed off from the outside environment. The chambers will filled up with a certain level of water and the rest of the chamber will filled with the chemicals methane, ammonia, and hydrogen. There was a small tank near the bottom to hold most of the water that was constantly supplied with heat. This heat acted as the heat from the Earth and helped produce precipitation. The precipitation would then travel into a larger tank that acted as the atmosphere. This larger tank contained two electrodes that would spark to simulated electrical storms. Then a small cooling pipe below the tank to induce condensation. The entire system modeled the water cycle of the early Earth.

After a week of the simulation running, Miller took a sample from the tap and discovered five amino acids in the sample. These included glycine, a-alanine, b-alanine, aspartic acid, and a-aminobutyric acid [2].

Although this formation of amino acids may sound trivial, it shows us that given the environment that we suspect is what made up the early atmosphere, amino acids can form. With the knowledge of amino acids that we have today, it is safe to conclude that this formation of amino acids was a major building block on which life developed.

## Prokaryote

The first cellular organisms that are believed to have formed are Prokaryotes. They are single cellular organisms and lack many of the complexities that we find in our cells [3]. Because of their basic composition and the fact that they are found in the oldest rocks on the planets leads us to conclude that they are of the oldest and earliest life forms on the planet. These organisms are believed to be the foundation on which evolved organisms came from such as plants and animals. They are also responsible for initially oxygenating the environment which is extremely helpful for us today. Although they may be small and simple, they have had huge impacts on the planet both in the function they performed and what they evolved to become.

## Continued Science

Although much of the scientific community agrees on the information provided, there is still much to determine. For example,
